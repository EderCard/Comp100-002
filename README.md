# Comp100-002 - Winter 2019

This repository contains C# Visual Studio Solutions for Comp100-002 class.

How did I get all these Visual Studio Projects on only one GitHub repository?
  On my disk I have a folder (ClassCode) wich contain others sub-folders, one for each "solution".
  From command prompt, go to that folder.
  Start git with this command: "git init" (This will create a local git repo).
  Put the file .gitignore there.
  On TeamExplorer home, commit to local repo using "Changes" option.
  On GitHub create an empty repository and get the url.
  On TeamExplorer home, sync to remote GitHub repository (paste the url)
  DONE!
